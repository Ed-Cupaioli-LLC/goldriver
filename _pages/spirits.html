    - title: STEAM POWER APPLE JACK
      content: Our seasonal Steam Power Applejack is made with 100% locally sourced apples from Apple Hill not too far away from the distillery in Camino, CA. All of our apple juice is fermented and distilled to perfection at Gold River Distillery then aged in bourbon barrels to produce our version of what is considered to be America’s first spirit! Although widely popular during colonial times in the United States. Not many distilleries produce this spirit today. Our Applejack tastes like bourbon at first, but finishes with hints of apple across the palate. Bourbon lovers looking for something different will love our Steam Power Applejack and those looking to try something new will love it just the same. We distill our Applejack in small quantities during harvest season, and generally only have limited supply between September and December. When September arrives, get your bottle while you have the chance! Inventory goes fast… <br>
