            <h1>OUR HAND-CRAFTED STILL</h1>
            <p>Our hand-crafted still is a gallon small batch, side mount column still with a gin column and a vodka column. The still was designed and fabricated almost entirely by our founder and distillery, Greg Baughman, the summer before we began production. A special thanks goes out to Matt Noel and Steve Habbestad for your very special and hard to find welding skills to help us complete our project on time!</p>
