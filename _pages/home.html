    header: OUR HAND-CRAFTED STILL
    content: Our hand-crafted still is a gallon small batch, side mount column still with a gin column and a vodka column. The still was designed and fabricated almost entirely by our founder and distillery, Greg Baughman, the summer before we began production. A special thanks goes out to Matt Noel and Steve Habbestad for your very special and hard to find welding skills to help us complete our project on time!

    header: IN CELEBRATION OF THE RICH HISTORY OF THE SACRAMENTO AREA
    content: "the first spirit we introduced was a gin, one of the more popular spirits during the time of prohibition. Wheel House American Dry Gin was received with high praise, as many were excited for an alternative to the more juniper-heavy style of a London Dry gin. In response to popular demand, we have produced several more products in the Wheel House spirit family: Wheel House Sacramento Vodka, Wheel House Absinthe Verte, Wheel House Drowning Oak Corn Whiskey, Wheel House California Bourbon and Wheel House Malted Rice Whiskey."
