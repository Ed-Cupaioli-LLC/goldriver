title: STEAM POWER APPLE JACK
content: Our seasonal Steam Power Applejack is made with 100% locally sourced apples
  from Apple Hill not too far away from the distillery in Camino, CA. All of our apple
  juice is fermented and distilled to perfection at Gold River Distillery then aged
  in bourbon barrels to produce our version of what is considered to be America’s
  first spirit! Although widely popular during colonial times in the United States.
  Not many distilleries produce this spirit today. Our Applejack tastes like bourbon
  at first, but finishes with hints of apple across the palate. Bourbon lovers looking
  for something different will love our Steam Power Applejack and those looking to
  try something new will love it just the same. We distill our Applejack in small
  quantities during harvest season, and generally only have limited supply between
  September and December. When September arrives, get your bottle while you have the
  chance! Inventory goes fast…
